Python version of Claude Code using the Gemini API.

Boot.dev Course "Build an Al Agent in Python"

⚠️ Learning tool only, not a production AI agent ⚠️

🚨 Hallucination for sure 🫠
"Agent" told me
- there was no bug after I had explicitly created one.
- Kept writing new scripts to print 17, ignoring existing code.
- Changed lots of code that was unnecessary.

I ended up going restoring to the last commit and not accepting any of the code.
